When you drop down you chose a place to land and then you try to find weapons and then try to kill the other players. You can also build in fortnite like walls, floors and ramps. With this you can build big building or just a small and easy ramp with walls around you. There is crates and chest that you can find in the game where you can get weapons or healments from like sheilds or meds.</p></b>
